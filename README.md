# Flooding Detection using Synthetic Aperture Radar

This project initially started to test out a flood mapping tool that the United Nations built using JavaScript. I converted it into Python and replicated most of the original functionality. In the next few weeks, I plan to incorporate Open Street Maps roads and building boundaries and combine it with Capella's SAR data and Planet Labs' high resolution imagery to build a fine-grained damage assessment.
